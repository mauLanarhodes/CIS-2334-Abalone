Categorize the abalones. (10 points)
The Marine Biologists discovered that certain abalones have some rare qualities. To further
investigate these rare qualities, the research team divided the abalone data into three
categories: Category I, Category II, and Category III. They believe that Category I and Category II
abalones have important research values. Category III abalones are normal abalones with
negligible research values. The following are the standards that this group of marine biologists
are using to categorize abalones. Each category contains several different rules.
At the top of your worksheet, you will display all the rows of data belonging to Category 1.
Then, you will next place all the rows of data belonging to Category 2. Finally, you will display all
the rows of data belonging to Category 3.
a. If an abalone sample satisfies one of the following criteria, it belongs to Category I:
1) Ring > 15 AND Infant.
2) Male AND Length > 0.75.
3) (Shell weight > 0.8 AND Shucked weight > 0.5) OR (Shucked weight > 1.2).
b. If an abalone sample does not belong to Category I and satisfies one of the following
criteria, it belongs to Category II:
1) (Shell weight < 0.4) AND (Shucked weight < 0.4).
2) (Ring > 15 AND Male) OR (RING > 18 AND Female).
3) Length < 0.36.
c. If an abalone sample doesnâ€™t belong to Category I or Category II, then the sample belongs to
Category III.
